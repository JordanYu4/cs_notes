## OSI Model 

- Logical model for how network systems communicate 
- Introduced by ISO in 1984 to standardize networks for multi-vendor networks 
- OSI model referenced only conceptually. TCP / IP model used in practicality. 

### Layers 
Sorted from layer closest to user to layer than sends data into network 
7. Application layer 
    - e.g. Outlook, Firefox, etc. 
    - SMTP, FTP, Telnet 
6. Presentation layer 
    - Operating system 
    - Format data, encryption
5. Session layer 
    - Communication of session between two computers (server and client)
    - Start / stop sessions 
4. Transport layer 
    - Decides how much info should be sent and received 
    - TCP, UDP, port numbers (source/destination)
3. Network layer 
    - Routers, DNS, IP address 
2. Data link layer 
    - Switching, MAC addresses 
1. Physical layer 
    - Wiring, hubs, network interface cards 

- Most network problems occur at physical layer 

#### Misc terminology 
- OSI - open systems interconnection 
- ARP - address resolution protocol 
- SMTP - simple mail transfer protocol 
- MAC - media access address
- Acronym: All People Seem To Need Data Processing 
- ISO - internet standards organization
